The goal of this notebook is to created use tje `gbfs` package to look at like data from capital bikeshare.




## Load Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
library(gbfs)
```

## Data Load

Using guidance from https://github.com/simonpcouch/gbfs , we will grab some DC data and plot.

```{r}
df_cities=get_gbfs_cities()
```


Looking up in the df_cities list, I find capital bikeshare code as "cabi".

```{r}
cabi_free=get_free_bike_status("cabi")
```
```{r}
cabi_free %>% ggplot(aes(x=lon,y=lat)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
get_free_bike_status("cabi")%>% ggplot(aes(x=lon,y=lat)) + geom_point()
```
