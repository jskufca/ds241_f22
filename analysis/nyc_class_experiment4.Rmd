Class play with NYC flights data.

Experiment 3 includes summarizing, looking to match another report.


## Load Packages

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

## Load flight data

Load the NYC 2013 flight data as `df`.

```{r}
df1=flights
```

## Class work

In class, we first looked at flights to MIAMI, creating a barplot.


```{r}
df6=df1 %>% 
  filter(dest=="MIA")


df6 %>% ggplot(aes(month)) + geom_bar()
```
Analyzing the graph above we note:

* December has the most flights, perhaps due to holiday.
* Feb is low, perhaps due to fewer days in Feb.
* Flight numbers seem to correlate with days in the month.


### Other destinations

We are interested in whether the Miami pattern is replicated at other airports. 
We consider six major airport:

* LAX - Los Angeles
* SAN - San Diego
* SFO - San Francisco
* ATL - Atlanta
* ORD - Chicago O'hare
* MIA - Miami

```{r}
df7=df1 %>% 
  filter(dest %in% c("LAX","SAN","SFO","ATL","ORD","MIA"))


df7 %>% ggplot(aes(x=month,fill=dest)) + geom_bar()
```
The stacked bar chart looks pretty, but we can't really compare the pattern across locations.   We will use *faceting* to separate the plots.

```{r}

df7 %>% ggplot(aes(month,fill=dest)) + geom_bar()+facet_wrap(~dest)
```
Observation from above graph:

* San Diego is much smaller than the others.
* MIA is _unusually_ flat.
* ORD is summer intensive (more traffic over summer)
* ORD, LAX, SFO patterns similar: low in winter, high in summer.
* ATL is flat, perhaps it's a hub.
* Feb is low (fewer days) and winter.

# Homework

## Another source of data - Bureau of Transportation

We will access a much larger data source, with WAY more data, should we want.  But ... we first focus on a particular download goal to get some data which is similar to what we were using.

## YOUR ACTION REQUIRED
 
Go to website  https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FIM&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4%20Pn44vr45 .  This dataset allows access to information on domestic flight and domestic carriers, with monthly summary data.


I want you to download the data for 2019, selecting all fields for download.


![Plot title. ](nyc_class_experiment2_insertimage_1.png)

> Save the download to your data_raw directory. It will be a zipfile, but that will be OK.  Don't change the name of the zipfile.


## Load the BOT data

We take advantage of the `here` package to get the path to the file that we stored.

Load that data into dataframe called `df2019` using the read_csv command.   Note that you do not need to unzip the file.

**NOTE** I use `clean_names` from the janitor package to get names formatted in a consistent and useable way.

```{r}
thisfile=here("data_raw","DL_SelectFields.zip")

df2019=read_csv(thisfile) %>% clean_names()
```

## Subsetting to data of interest

Let's focus on flights from La Guardia (airport "LGA") and eliminate cargo flights by requiring at leat 1 passenger.

Call the resultant dataframe `df9`.

```{r}
df9=df2019 %>% filter(passengers>0,origin=="LGA")

```

We create a barchart as we have done before:

```{r}
df9 %>% ggplot(aes(month)) + geom_bar()
```
By default, `geom_bar` is counting the number of rows, where we asked it to visualize the count by `month`.  

** Take a look at the dataset and discover why counting rows is not going to give us a count of flights. **

The visualization we want is:

```{r}
df9 %>% ggplot(aes(month)) + geom_bar(aes(weight=departures_performed))
```
Make some observations about this plot.


### A new visualization

Can you make a boxplot where the bar height is based on the number of passengers riding each month.




### Just because you can


Here is pretty, but not so useful plot.

```{r}
df9 %>% ggplot(aes(month,fill=carrier_name)) + geom_bar(aes(weight=departures_performed))
```
## Arrivals and departures from LGA

```{r}
df10=df2019 %>% filter(passengers>0,origin=="LGA" | dest=="LGA")

df10 %>% ggplot(aes(month)) + geom_bar(aes(weight=passengers))
```

```{r}
df11=df10 %>% select(month,passengers,seats, carrier_name, dest, origin)

df12=df10 %>% select(1:5, month, contains("id") )

df13=df11 %>% mutate(percent_loading = passengers/seats*100)

df13 %>% ggplot(aes(percent_loading)) +
  geom_histogram()+facet_wrap(~carrier_name,scales="free_y")

```

### Summarize data

```{r}
df15=df2019 %>% filter(passengers>0,origin=="LGA" | dest=="LGA") %>% 
  group_by(month,carrier_name) %>% 
  summarise(total_pass=sum(passengers),  num_flights=sum(departures_performed)) %>%
  mutate(average_pass_per_flight=total_pass/num_flights)


df15 
df15 
```

















```{r}
df15=df2019 %>% filter(passengers>0,origin=="LGA" | dest=="LGA") %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% mutate(percent_loading = passengers/seats*100) %>%
  summarise(loading=mean(percent_loading)) 
```

```{r}
df16=df2019 %>% filter(passengers>0,origin=="LGA" | dest=="LGA") %>% 
  group_by(month,carrier_name) %>% mutate(percent_loading = passengers/seats*100) %>%
  summarise(loading=mean(percent_loading)) 
```

```{r}
df16 %>% ggplot(aes(x=month,y=loading,color=carrier_name))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+geom_line()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

### cargo questions - which airport

```{r}
df17=df2019 %>% filter(origin_city_name=="New York, NY" ) %>% 
  group_by(month,origin) %>% 
  summarise(freight=sum(freight,na.rm = FALSE),passengers=sum(passengers),n=n()) 
df17
```
